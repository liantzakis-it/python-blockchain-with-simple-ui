# python-blockchain-with-simple-ui

A blockchain implementation using Python, Bootstrap and Vue.js.

It is required that you have Flask and PyCryptodome installed in order to run the programme.
Easy way to do so would be to browse the Anaconda Navigator for the said packages in the tab "Environment".

To run the blockchain implementation, type the following command in your terminal or command line: python node.py . If no more arguments are given, the programme will be executed on the default port (7500). If you want to run it on a specific port, e.g. port 7501, you'd have to type: python node.py -p 7501.
